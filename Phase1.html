            <h4> Reason Behind topic of urban planning </h4>
            <p>
                This topic interests me, and Iâ€™ve learned it from playing games like Cities Skylines and Sim City,
                where you manage and build a city. These games led me to want to learn more about how cities are
                planned, and I took Geography 2535: Introduction to Planning to learn more about urban and city
                planning. This site, as such, is about introducing the topic and then providing resources to look
                into it further if desired.

            <h4> What is Urban Planning </h4>

            <p>
                Urban or city planning is the process of designing and managing how physical, social and economic
                development occurs in a built environment like a city, town, etc. City planning attempts to predict
                and shape how a city will develop in the future, basing a lot of what is done or planned on a variety of
                aspects, such as:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Trying to Anticipate how the city will look or function in the future.</li>
                <li>Assessing the current and trying to predict potential needs in a city. </li>
                <li>
                    The change of demographics in a city over time and how that difference in demographics,
                    between now and then could impact the development and other factor in the city.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The goal of city planning is to ensure that a city which is a continually evolving environment can
                develop in an organized and sustainable manner. Overtime shaping patterns of community growth and
                the overall quality of life in a city
