                City planning follows a process that starts with nonspecific ideas and concepts based on research and
                data gathered,and these ideas slowly become more specific. Eventually, after many stages, a final
                detailed plan and policies are formed. The planning process can be organized into the following phases:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <!-- big ideas -->
                <li>
                    <h4>
                        Big Ideas (long-range planning):
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        This phase is where planners research and gather data about the current state of an area,
                        including things like population demographics, environmental conditions, existing city services,
                        and infrastructure.
                        The data gathered, in conjunction with other planning documents, help form the overall vision
                        for the area. This phase's resulting plans and policies are high-level but act as blueprints for
                        refinement.
                    </p>
                    <p> Some tools/documents used and created in this phase include: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h5>
                                The official city plan or Municipal Development Plan
                            </h5>
                            <p>
                                This formal document guides a city's long-term development, growth and policy decisions.
                                This document is the overall vision of how the city should be developed and is meant to
                                provide the framework for how developments within the city get designed, planned and
                                developed.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5>
                                Inter-municipal Development Plans
                            </h5>
                            <p>
                                These are documents made by a city in cooperation with neighboring cities to determine
                                how future growth and development in the areas between should be handled/carried out.
                                This document ensures constant and continued cooperative growth and development between
                                the cities/municipalities.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                    </ul>
                </li>

                <!-- Refined plans -->
                <li>
                    <h4>
                        Refined plans
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        In this phase, more research reflects the overall vision for the area occurs. Data gathered here
                        is then used to build on top of the high-level plans and policies from the last phase, resulting
                        in more detailed plans and policies being created.
                    </p>

                                The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed framework for the development of a
                                specific large area within a municipality. These documents designate a specific area's
                                land usage, ultimately allowing planners to understand how an area will look when
                                developed.
                            </p>

                    <p>
                        This phase is where the final plan builds upon plans created in the last phase and forms a more
                        detailed/focused plan. This plan is then reviewed and revised, eventually becoming the final
                        plan or policy, which is very detailed and exact.
